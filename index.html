                <h3>Here's the story of my family, consisting of five wonderful people. For me, they are my source of strength and happiness.</h3>
                <p>My father, <b>Ajiswarman</b>, is someone I truly admire. He is very wise and responsible. Though he seems strict, especially when giving advice about the importance of discipline and hard work, he always shows his softer side at home. I remember how my dad enjoys gathering us together in the afternoons just to talk while sipping tea. He's not one to express his feelings openly, but I know that behind his calm demeanor, he loves us all deeply.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, my mother, <b>Niswalti Fatma</b>, is the heart of our home, always full of love and care. She makes sure that we all feel comfortable, both physically and emotionally. Her cooking is the best, especially on weekends when the whole family gathers to enjoy her special meals. Besides her amazing cooking skills, my mom is also our biggest motivator. She constantly encourages me and my siblings to keep chasing our dreams. If there's one thing I've learned from her, it's the importance of being thoughtful and understanding toward others.</p>
                <p>I also have an amazing older sister, <b>Aqilah Fitri Chania</b>. She's smart, independent, and very dependable. Even though she's often busy with her own matters, Aqilah always takes the time to give me advice or just listen to my stories. She's a role model for me in terms of academic success and perseverance. I often think about how lucky I am to have a sister like her—someone who's not only a friend but also a guide in many aspects of life.</p>
                <p>As the middle child, I, <b>Ammar Radhi</b>, sometimes feel like I play a unique role in the family. I often find myself acting as the mediator between my older sister and younger sibling, or even between my parents. I always try to be a good brother and help my family as much as I can. I enjoy learning new things and often have plenty of ideas I want to bring to life. For me, my family is where I can feel at peace and be myself.</p>
                <p>My youngest sibling, <b>Azizah Faiqah Chania</b>, is the joy of our home. Her sweet and innocent behavior always manages to make us smile. Even though she's the youngest, she's incredibly smart and curious. Azizah constantly asks questions that make us all think, and she's always excited about everything she does. She's a little sister I truly cherish, and I'm happy to watch her grow into such a cheerful and energetic person.</p>
                <p><em>My family may not be perfect, but we always strive to support and care for each other. My parents have taught us the importance of togetherness, and although we sometimes have our differences, we always come back together as a strong family unit. I'm so grateful to have grown up with them, and every day spent with my family is a blessing that I'll never take for granted.</em></p>

                <p>My name is Ammar Radhi Aziz Chan. I was born in Solok, a peaceful and beautiful small town. Although I only lived there until I was two years old, Solok still holds a special place in my life. Afterward, my family moved to Palembang, and it's there that I grew up, shaping much of who I am today.</p>
                <p>Since I was young, I've always been fascinated by technology. My curiosity led me to the world of computers, and the more I explored, the more I realized that this was the field I wanted to pursue. Now, I'm studying at IPB University, majoring in Computer Science. Here, I'm learning a lot of things—from programming and algorithms to software development. Every day is a new opportunity to dive deeper into the world of technology.</p>
                <p>Besides my studies at university, I'm also taking part in the Bangkit program, a technology development initiative that aligns perfectly with my major. This program not only equips me with knowledge but also gives me the chance to sharpen the skills that will be invaluable in the tech industry in the future.</p>
                <p>With determination and enthusiasm, I keep moving forward, building my dreams and preparing myself for future challenges. I believe that with all the experiences and knowledge I'm gaining, I can achieve great things.</p>
